SongPlayListApp is a Java-based application designed to manage and organize songs into playlists. Built using Core Java, the application allows users to perform various 
operations such as adding, deleting, and updating songs, creating custom playlists, and playing tracks. It leverages object-oriented programming principles and core Java
features like collections, file handling, and exception management to provide a seamless user experience. This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement 
real-world applications using Core Java concepts.
